# 🏀 NBA Fantasy Points Across Eras  
### *By Yara He*

Over the past 27 NBA seasons — from 1996–97 to the modern era — the league has drastically evolved.  
The pace increased. Shot profiles shifted. Stars took on heavier playmaking loads. And as a result, **NBA Fantasy Points** (a combined performance metric) changed across eras and across player careers.

This article uses a dataset of **over 15,000 player-seasons** to help readers explore:

- How fantasy production has changed through time  
- Which ages and career stages produce the most impact  
- How league context and team environment influence player output  

The data comes from the dataset `player_stats_scoring_rs.csv`, which includes 43 statistical features per player-season.

# 🧠 What We Learn From the Data

### 1. Player usage and responsibility have increased  
Modern stars contribute more across scoring, assists, and playmaking, boosting fantasy totals.

### 2. Age strongly predicts performance  
Fantasy output rises quickly, peaks in the late 20s, then declines gradually in the 30s.

### 3. Team environment matters  
Players on strong teams often score more efficiently, while players on weaker teams may accumulate stats through higher usage.
