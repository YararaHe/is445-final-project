## Why Fantasy Points?
NBA fantasy points combine many box-score stats (points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, etc.) into one number. For public readers, that’s useful because it turns “overall impact” into a single score that is easier to compare across players and seasons.

In this project, I use player regular-season data from **1996–97 to 2022–23** to explore how fantasy production changed across eras—and what factors (like age) relate to higher fantasy impact. The goal is to make trends readable for non-experts while keeping the visuals interactive and transparent.

## ⭐ Central Interactive Visualization: Average Fantasy Points by Season
This main interactive chart shows how **average NBA fantasy points per season** change over time. Hover to see the season value and look for long-term shifts across eras.

**What to notice:** Modern seasons tend to show higher fantasy production. This is consistent with well-known NBA changes like increased pace, spacing, and high-usage offensive stars.

## Context Visualization 1: Fantasy Points vs Age
A common fan question is: **what age is a player’s “prime”?** This chart looks at the relationship between player age and fantasy points (sampled for smooth loading).

</div>

**Interpretation:** Many high-output seasons cluster in the mid-to-late 20s, while younger seasons often show more variance as players develop and roles change.

## Context Visualization 2: Top Fantasy Performances (Single Season)
To connect the big-picture trend to real examples, this visualization highlights some of the most dominant fantasy seasons in the dataset.

These “peak seasons” provide concrete anchors for what “high fantasy production” looks like in practice.
